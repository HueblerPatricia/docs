# Lia-Script

                                    --{{0}}--
With Lia, we try to implement an extended Markdown format that should enable
everyone to create, share, adapt, translate or correct and extend online courses
without the need of being a web-developer.

See the online rendered version at:
https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md

                                    --{{0}}--
Click on the (ear) button at the navigation bar to switch between spoken and
plain text mode format. And use the arrows-buttons at the top for navigating.


*Lia-Script* <!-- class = "animated infinite bounce" style = "color: red;" onclick = "alert('It started with a click!');" -->
is an extended Markdown format for writing interactive online
courses. Imagine all schoolbooks, technical or scientific literature could
become open-source projects and more interactive ... with collaborating teachers
and students ...

* easy to share adapt and translate
* no additional software required, everything is implemented in JavaScirpt/Elm
  and runs directly within the browser (online)
* automatic conversion to epub, pdf, ...


                                     --{{1}}--
Everything that is required is simple text-editor and a web-browser. Or you
start directly to create and share your course on github. The entire parsing and
transformation of Lia-Markdown to any other format is done within the browser at
client-side.


## Tools

                                     --{{0}}--
There are currently 2 Plugins for the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/) available,
which are intended to ease and simplify the development of online course with
LiaScript.

[liascript-preview](https://atom.io/packages/liascript-preview): Is a tiny
previewer that, if it was toggled, updates the view on your course each time you
save your document.


![previewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andre-dietrich/liascript-preview/master/preview.gif)<!-- style="width: 100%" -->

[liascript-snippets](https://atom.io/packages/liascript-snippets): If you start
typing "lia" in your document you switch on a fuzzy search, that contains a lot
of LiaScript help, examples, and snippets.

## *Markdown*-Syntax


                                     --{{0}}--
This section is intended to give a brief overview on the basic Markdown
formatting elements. The only difference to common Markdown at this point is,
that every course has to start with a comment, which defines authors, a language
and  a narrator voice, see https://responsivevoice.org for all supported voices.

Initial LIA-comment-tag for basic definitions:

``` XML
<!--

author:   Andre Dietrich

email:    LiaScript@web.de

version:  0.0.1

language: en

narrator: US English Female

script:   javascript resourse url

script:   another javascript resourse url

link:     some css stuff
          and some more css

-->
```


### Structuring

                                    --{{0}}--
A course is structured as any other Markdown document with starting hash-tags,
whereby the number of hash-tags is used to define the hierarchy.

```markdown
# Main Title

 ...

## Section Title 1

 ...

### Subsection Title

 ...
## Section Title 2
```

### Text-Formatting

                                    --{{0}}--
We tried to use the github flavored Markdown style for simple formatting with
some additional elements.

\*italic\* -> *italic*

\*\*bold\*\* -> **bold**

\*\*\*bold and italic \*\*\* -> ***bold and italic ***

\_also italic\_ -> _also italic_

\_\_also bold\_\_ -> __also bold__

\_\_\_also bold and italic\_\_\_ -> ___also bold and italic___

\~strike\~ -> ~strike~

                                     --{{1}}--
These exceptions are for example underline and its combination with strike
through or the application of superscript. If you, for example, superscript
superscript you can get even smaller.

                                       {{1}}
********************************************************************************

\~\~underline\~\~ -> ~~underline~~

\~\~\~strike and underline\~\~\~ -> ~~~strike and underline~~~

\^superscript\^ -> ^superscript^ ^^superscript^^ ^^^superscript^^^

********************************************************************************


#### Combinations

                                     --{{0}}--
As you can see from the examples, you can combine all elements freely.


\*\*bold \_bold italic\_\*\* -> **bold _italic_**

\*\*\~bold strike\~ \~\~bold underline\~\~\*\* -> **~bold strike~ ~~bold underline~~**

\*\~italic strike\~ \~\~italic underline\~\~\* -> *~italic strike~ ~~italic underline~~*

#### Escape Characters

\*, \~, \_, \#, \{, \}, \[, \], \|, \`, \$

                                     --{{0}}--
If you want to use multiple stars, hash-tags, or other syntax elements within
your script without applying their functionality, then you can escape them with
a starting backslash.

### Symbols

                                     --{{0}}--
One thing that we missed in standard Markdown, was an implementation for arrows.
The parenthesis shows, how arrows are defined in our Markdown implementation with
their result on the right (these symbols are generated automatically for you).

(`->`) ->, (`->>`) ->>, (`>->`) >->, (`<-`) <-, (`<-<`) <-<,
(`<<-`) <<-, (`<->`) <->, (`=>`) =>, (`<=`) <=, (`<=>`) <=>

(`-->`) -->, (`<--`) <--, (`<-->`) <-->, (`==>`) ==>, (`<==`) <==, (`<==>`) <==>

(`~>`) ~>, (`<~`) <~

                                     --{{1}}--
But you can also use some basic smileys. We will try to extend this partial
support in the future.

                                       {{1}}
`:-)` :-), `;-)` ;-), `:-D` :-D, `:-O` :-O, `:-(` :-(, `:-|` :-|,
`:-/` :-/, `:-P` :-P, `:-*` :-*, `:')` :'), `:'(` :'(

### References

The next section shows how external resources can be integrated.

#### Simple Links

                                     --{{0}}--
There are two ways of adding links to a Markdown document, either by inlining
the url directly or you can name it, as shown in listing 2, by applying the
typical brackets and parenthesis notation, the optional info is put in double
quotes at the end of the url.


1. example of an url-link -> http://goo.gl/fGXNvu

   text-formatting can be applied also (`*** http://goo.gl/fGXNvu ***`) ->
   *** http://goo.gl/fGXNvu ***

2. naming the link (`[title](http://goo.gl/fGXNvu "optional info")`) -> [title](http://goo.gl/fGXNvu "click Me")

3. For internal navigation you can refer to the slide number or to title with
   with a starting `#`

   * `[next slide](#11)` -> [next slide](#11)
   * `[next slide](#images-and-movies)` -> [next slide](#images-and-movies)

#### Images and Movies

                                    --{{0}}--
Images are marked with a starting exclamation mark before the link, audio by a
starting question mark and movies are made of images and sound, that is why you
combine both marks `!?`. Defining ressources this way shows at least the links
correctly in other Markdown parsers or on github. There is baked-in support for
[YouTube](https://YouTube.com), [Soundcloud](https://Soundcloud.com),
[Vimeo](https://Vimeo.com) and [TeacherTube](https://TeacherTube.com), which
means that you only have to include the link and the resource will be embedded
appropriately.

### Styling

                                    --{{0}}--
Adding CSS elements or classes or any other HTML setting to an image or to any
other Markdown element is implemented via a trailing comment-tag, everything
within this comment is treated as a HTML attribute, so that it can
also be used to apply graphical filters of for positioning.


``` markdown
![image](...Creative-Tail-Animal-lion.svg)<!--
style = "width: 100px;
         border: 10px solid;
         filter: grayscale(100%);"

class = "animated infinite bounce"
-->
```


![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Creative-Tail-Animal-lion.svg)<!--
style = "width: 100px;
         border: 10px solid;
         filter: grayscale(100%);"

class = "animated infinite bounce"
-->
![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Creative-Tail-Animal-lion.svg)<!--
style="

  style="width: 140px;
  border: 10px solid;"
-->
![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Creative-Tail-Animal-lion.svg)<!--
  style="width: 120px;
  border: 10px solid;
  -webkit-filter: grayscale(100%); /* Safari 6.0 - 9.0 */
  filter: grayscale(100%);"
-->
![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Creative-Tail-Animal-lion.svg)<!--
  style="width: 100px;
  border: 10px solid;
  -webkit-filter: blur(5px); /* Safari 6.0 - 9.0 */
  filter: blur(5px);"
-->

                                     --{{1}}--
The same technique can also be applied to style and format movies and other inline
elements, such as links, words, symbols, or code...

********************************************************************************


#### Block-Styling

                                  --{{0}}--
Settings for entire blocks can be set with a **starting** comment that includes
all required HTML-attributes and can even contain animation settings. These can
be used to highlight specific elements of your slides.


``` markdown
<!-- class = "animated rollIn" style = "animation-delay: 3s; color: purple" -->
The whole text-block should appear in purple color and with a wobbling effect.
Which is a **bad** example, please use it with causion ...
~~ ;-) ~~ <!-- class = "animated infinite bounce" style = "color: red;" -->
```

~~ ;-) ~~ <!-- class = "animated infinite bounce" style = "color: red;" -->

### Lists & Tables

Within the following part enumerations, itemizations and tables are presented,
actually with no difference to basic Markdown, so you can skip this section,
if you are already familiar with it.

#### Unordered Lists

                                 --{{0}}--
To define unordered list, starting stars, pluses, and minuses can be used and
mixed. If one point has more than one line, you can also use newlines, but with
spaces at the beginning. Paragraphs can be included in the same way, by using
two newlines.

Markdown-format:

``` markdown
* alpha
+ *beta*
- gamma
  and delta

  new Paragraph
```

Result:

* alpha
+ *beta*
- gamma
  and delta

  new Paragraph


#### Ordered Lists

                                 --{{0}}--
Ordered list start with a number and a dot. As you can see from the example, the
numbering is important, n contrast to the github flavored Markdown. This way you
can separate lists, add something in between, make use of animations and
effects. And it is also possible to mix lists with other lists and elements
freely.

Markdown-format:

``` markdown
0. alpha
2. **beta**
1. * gamma
   * delta
   * and epsilon
3. probably zeta
```

Result:

0. alpha
2. **beta**
1. * gamma
   * delta
   * and epsilon
3. probably zeta

#### Tables

                                   --{{0}}--
Tables, we hope, are self-explanatory. The second line is used to define a table
header as well as the alignment of the column, which is indicated by the colon.
The default is left alignment.

Markdown-format:

``` markdown
| Tables            | Are           | Cool  |
| ----------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| *** col 3 is ***  | right-aligned | $1600 |
| ** col 2 is **    | centered      |   $12 |
| * zebra stripes * | are neat      |    $1 |
```

Result:

| Tables            | Are           | Cool  |
| ----------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| *** col 3 is ***  | right-aligned | $1600 |
| ** col 2 is **    | centered      |   $12 |
| * zebra stripes * | are neat      |    $1 |


                                   --{{1}}--
As you can see in the LiaScript interpreted version, tables can be sorted
according to a column, either ascending or descending. But why stopping here?
Every table also defines a dataset, right. So why not simply using it to
directly plot graphs, scatter-plots, or bar-charts.


                                   --{{2}}--
If the first column of a table contains only numbers, and the other columns
contain some numbers, then these values can be directly plotted. The first
column  thus describes always the x values and the rest is up to you. Use the
small icon above the table to switch between table view and plotted version.

    {{2}}
``` md
| x's |  some y's  |    dist |
| --- |:----------:| -------:|
| 1   |    1 \$    | 16 $km$ |
| 2.2 |    2 \$    | 12 $km$ |
| 3.3 |    5 \$    |  1 $km$ |
| 4   | -12.333 \$ |         |
```

    {{2}}
| x's |  some y's  |    dist |
| --- |:----------:| -------:|
| 1   |    1 \$    | 16 $km$ |
| 2.2 |    2 \$    | 12 $km$ |
| 3.3 |    5 \$    |  1 $km$ |
| 4   | -12.333 \$ |         |


                                   --{{3}}--
A function cannot turn an x value into different y values, thus, if you have at
least one x value twice, the resulting plot will be a scatter plot. By the way,
only the first word in a cell (separated by spaces) gets interpreted as a
number. If you don't want this to happen for a certain cell, then simply attach
something directly to the number, add a character in front of it or use the math
notation.

    {{3}}
``` markdown
| x's |  some y's  |                              dist |
| --- |:----------:| ---------------------------------:|
| 1   |    1 \$    |                           16 $km$ |
| 2.2 |    2 \$    |                           12 $km$ |
| 3.3 |    5 \$    |                            1 $km$ |
| 4   | -12.333 \$ | -555$km$ <-- this will be ignored |
| 4   |            |                                 1 |
```

    {{3}}
| x's |  some y's  |                              dist |
| --- |:----------:| ---------------------------------:|
| 1   |    1 \$    |                           16 $km$ |
| 2.2 |    2 \$    |                           12 $km$ |
| 3.3 |    5 \$    |                            1 $km$ |
| 4   | -12.333 \$ | -555$km$ <-- this will be ignored |
| 4   |            |                                 1 |


                                   --{{4}}--
Last but not least _bar-charts_. If the first column contains at least one cell,
that cannot be parsed as a number, while the other columns still have numbers,
then this table gets interpreted as a bar-chart. The first column thus defines
your set of groups. It is now also possible to sort your table according to
different columns and see this ordering also within the bar-chart representation.

### Blockquotes

Markdown-format:

``` markdown
<!--
style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; width: 500px; margin: 0.25em 0;"
-->
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps...
```

Result:

<!--
style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; width: 500px; margin: 0.25em 0;"
-->
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.


                                   --{{1}}--
Next to simple paragraphs also any other block element can be included ...

### HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.
Mixing HTML with Markdown is also possible, but it should be used with caution,
since it is mixing two different styles of parsing.

```HTML
Test **bold** and <b> HTML bold</b> works also inline

<details>

<summary>$ f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3 $</summary>

<p>
Here is the source data that is discussed in the article ...
</p>

<dl>
  <dt style="color: red">Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt><b>Markdown in HTML</b></dt>
  <dd>Does _work_ **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

</details>
```

#### HTML & JavaScirpt

                                 --{{0}}--
In contrast to common Markdown-Parsers it is also possible to include and
execute javascript code. If you combine it with your HTML elements, you are free
to integrate whatever you want.

``` html
<div class="ct-chart ct-golden-section" id="chart"></div>
<script>
    // Initialize a Line chart in the container with the ID chart
    new Chartist.Line('#chart', {
        labels: [1, 2, 3, 4],
        series: [[100, 120, 180, 200]]
    });
</script>
```


                                   {{0-1}}
<div class="ct-chart ct-golden-section" id="chart1"></div>
<script>
// Initialize a Line chart in the container with the ID chart1
new Chartist.Line('#chart1', {
  labels: [1, 2, 3, 4],
  series: [[100, 120, 180, 200]]
});
</script>


                                     {{1}}
<div class="ct-chart ct-golden-section" id="chart2"></div>
<script>
// Initialize a Line chart in the container with the ID chart2
new Chartist.Line('#chart2', {
  labels: [1, 2, 3, 4],
  series: [[-100, 120, 180, 20]]
});
</script>

                                --{{2}}--
Note, you have to include all required JavaScirpt-resourses in the initial
comment after the script definition. And by combining this feature with
LiaScript effects, you can build even more sophisticated courses.


### HTML Hiding Content

There might be use cases where you either want to show some parts only within
the HTML world and others only withing the LiaScript world. As it was shortly
introduced in the section about styling, you can add comments to the start of
every block to add additional attributes. These attributes can be used a trigger
to hide or show content.

``` markdown
<!-- style="display:block" -->
<div style="display:none">

only visible in LiaScript

</div>

-----------------------------------------------

<!-- style="display:none" -->
<div style="display:block" width="200px">

Not visible in LiaScript, but everywhere else

</div>
```

The attributes within the comment overwrite the attributes within the block,
thus, if there would be more stuff within style, this will be overwritten, but
other attributes like `width` wont...

## Footnotes

    --{{0}}--
There are two types of footnotes, either inline or divided ones (into two
parts). The the footnotbody is only showed in textbook mode, or if you click
on the marker.

1. Inline Footnote[^1](explanation in one line) => `[^1](explanation in one line)`
2. Divided into a marker[^2] => `[^2]`, that can appeare every where and an
   explanation at the bottom of a section.

   ```md
   [^2]: This is an explanation, than
         can consist of multiple blocks.
   ```

[^2]: This is an explanation, than
      can consist of multiple blocks.


## Math-Mode

{{0}} via KaTex http://katex.org

{{1}} Inline math-mode `$ \frac{a}{\sum{b+i}} $` -> $ \frac{a}{\sum{b+i}} $

                                        {{2}}
Multi-line math-mode can be applied by double dollars `$$ formula $$`
$$
  \frac{a}{\sum{b+i}}
$$

                                    --{{0}}--
We apply KaTeX for math-formatting, see the documentation at www.katex.org.

                                    --{{1}}--
A formula can be either inline with single dollars.

                                    --{{2}}--
Or multi-line by using the double dollar notation.

## Syntax Highlighting

The following section shows a three types of code blocks, simple inline and
block-code as well as interactive block-code, as an extension to common
Markdown.

### Inline-Code

Inline code via \` enter some code in here 1\#\#\#\$& \` -> ` enter some code in here 1###$& `

### Block-Code

                                --{{0}}--
Syntax highlighting is enabled with highlight.js. Blocks of code are either by
lines with three back-ticks \`\`\` and an identifier for the language. See a
complete list of examples and how to write language names at the
[highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

````` markdown
```language <- (python, c, javascript, ...)  +OptionalTitle

code ...

```
`````

C example:

``` c Sample.cpp
#include "test.h"

int main () {
    printf("this is an example\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Python example:

``` python
import math

def lia_sqrt(val):
    return math.sqrt(val) + 22
```

### Interactive Code

                                    --{{0}}--

Why should code examples not be interactive and editable, especially if it is
JavaScript or any other language that has been ported to it? Simply add the
required resources to the initial comment with keyword `script`.

1. Add resource to main-comment: `script: url.js`

2. Add a trailing script-tag to your code: `<script>@input</script>`

3. A project with multiple files can be realized with `@input(0)`, `@input(1)`, ...,`@input(n)`.


                                     --{{1}}--
And add an additional script tag to the end of your language definition with an
`@input` macro. This element is afterwards substituted with your code and
executed. We provide some basic examples within the following section.

                                    --{{2}}--
Use the `@input` macro as a parameterized function in projects. The number
defines the the file, starting from 0.



#### JavaScript

                                    --{{0}}--
Click on the run-button to execute the script or double-click on the code to
edit it and to change the output ...

Double-click on the code to switch to edit mode and double-click to get out:

``` javascript
var i=0;
var j=0;
var result = 0;

for(i = 0; i<1000; i++) {
    for(j = 0; j<i; j++) {
        result += j;
    }
}
// the last statement defines the return statement
result;
```
<script>@input</script>

#### Projects

                --{{0}}--
Multiple different code snippets can be combined to form a larger project. It
requires to write them in a row. You can give them names, if you add a second
parameter after the highlighting definition. Add a `+` or `-` to the front of
your filename, in order to indicate, if it should be visible by default or not.

                --{{1}}--
As mentioned earlier the `@input` macro gets substituted by the input of the
editor and you can pass a number to indicate which macro should be substituted
by which code block (`@input(0)` is equivalent to `@input`).

```` markdown
``` js     -EvalScript.js
let who = data.first_name + " " + data.last_name;

if(data.online) {
  who + " is online"; }
else {
  who + " is NOT online"; }
```
``` json    +Data.json
{
  "first_name" :  "Sammy",
  "last_name"  :  "Shark",
  "online"     :  true
}
```
<script>
  // insert the JSON dataset into the local variable data
  let data = @input(1);

  // eval the script that uses this dataset
  eval(`@input(0)`);
</script>

````

``` js     -EvalScript.js
let who = data.first_name + " " + data.last_name;

if(data.online) {
  who + " is online"; }
else {
  who + " is NOT online"; }
```
``` json    +Data.json
{
  "first_name" :  "Sammy",
  "last_name"  :  "Shark",
  "online"     :  true
}
```
<script>
  // insert the JSON dataset into the local variable data
  let data = @input(1);

  // eval the script that uses this dataset
  eval(`@input(0)`);
</script>


#### Communication

The easiest way to execute some code, is simply to add a script-tag to the end
of your code-block. But, sometimes an execution takes longer or requires to
execute some asynchronous code. For this purpose, LiaScript offers a simple
event system that will be explained in more detail. For simplicity the entire
code block will contain all JavaScript code that can be edited and executed.
This can be placed afterwards below the code block.


To every executed peace of code a `send` module is associated, that is intended
to handle all required communication with that specific code-block or project
and the outer world. Thus, every `send` module is module does only exists in
this particular scope.

To start with, there is a `log` method, which can be used to send different
types of outputs directly to the console. But, you can of course also use the
`console.log` functions that do quite the same. Nevertheless, `send.log` gives
you a little more power when you start to create your own LiaScript libraries
and you have to handle multiple outputs.

``` js
/* send.log(type, sep, content)
*
* params:
*  - type: one of the follow strings "debug", "info", "warn", "error"
*  - sep: a string like separator, mostly for newlines "\n"...
*  - content : represents a list of list
*/

console.debug("these are short hands for send.log('debug' ... ")
console.warn("warn")
console.log("info")
console.error("and red for errors")

"fin"
```
<script>@input</script>


As you may have noticed, the last statement of an executed code-block does also
define the `return` statement. However, there are some results that are treated
differently. These are strings that start with `"LIA: "`. The string
`"LIA: stop"` for example, is used to tell the system to simply stop the
execution, without any further output.

``` js
33*33

"LIA: stop" // if you remove this string the result of the
            // calculation will be visible in the shell
```
<script>@input</script>

If the execution of your code may take longer, include some asynchronous calls
or you need to call an external service, you can tell this by finishing with the
statement `"LIA: wait"`, which will show arrows that loop forever or until they
receive a `"LIA: stop"` signal.

``` js
setTimeout(function(){
  console.warn("end of execution")

  send.lia("some other ouput")

  send.lia("LIA: stop") // this stops the execution
}, 3000)


"LIA: wait" // wait until you you send a stop
```
<script>@input</script>

You might probably wonder, why there is a need for `send.lia`, if you could also
pipe output to the console by using `send.log` or the shorthand `console.log`.
As it will be described in the section about error handling, `send.lia` gives
you more control, not only over the shell but also over the editor, see section
[Error Handling](#Error-Handling).

The code example below, depicts how the terminal can be exposed, following the
previous logic, we only have to define `"LIA: terminal"` as the last statement
in order to switch on the terminal mode, that will be active until the user
clicks on the stop button, formerly known as the execute button, or a
`"LIA: stop"` is send from the script, or the browser gets refreshed.

In order to handle the `input` and the `stop` events from the terminal in the
JavaScript world, we have to define handles, as it is done in the code below.
Simply add a function, that evaluates or sends your terminal inputs to a foreign
server or a websocket, or ... whatever you want ... And use the stop handle to
close a connection or do some other stuff, if the user clicks onto the stop
button.

``` js
send.handle("input", input => {
  try{
    console.log(eval(input))
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
})

send.handle("stop", e => { alert("execution stopped") })

function close(){
  send.lia("LIA: stop")
}

"LIA: terminal" // execute the code and
```
<script>@input</script>

A little side note, there is also a function called `console.clear`, that does
what it says it clears the console, but it is not a realized by `send.log`,
instead this is a shortcut for `send.lia("LIA: clear")`. These were all

`"LIA: ..."` commands, the next section you will learn how to use the custom
built in event system to get even more stuff done.

##### Ping Pong

All previous functions were executed only within the scope of a single
code-block, but sometimes it is necessary to connect with other external events.
For this purpose, the `send` object also contains two further generic functions,
these are `register` and `dispatch`. Simply use a unique identifier to name an
event, which is followed by a callback-function that does whatever you want.
Both callbacks are defined in local scope, but by using `register` and
`dispatch` you can send messages to any code-block. The example below also
delivers the messages successfully, if both code-blocks would be defined on
different slides.


``` js
send.register("ping", function(e){
  console.warn("ping", e)
})

send.handle("input", input => {
  send.dispatch("pong", input)
})

"LIA: terminal" // execute the code and
```
<script>@input</script>



``` js
send.register("pong", function(e){
  console.warn("pong", e)
})

send.handle("input", input => {
  send.dispatch("ping", input)
})

"LIA: terminal" // execute the code and
```
<script>@input</script>


Adding such script-tags to the end of every code-block can be very tedious and
cumbersome. Your Markdown will contain a lot of not necessary copy & paste code.
To reduce this, LiaScript offers the possibility to define custom macros, and
even more, you can directly import macros from other courses. Section
[Macros](#Macros) is used to describe this issue in more.


##### Error Handling

As mentioned earlier, `send.lia` can do more then just passing messages to the
terminal output. The editor that is currently used by LiaScript is [ace](todo),
which allows to mark lines with warnings and errors. Since there is no name
associated to a file (like with the `@input(0)` macro). You have to use a list
of lists,  which contain all necessary information that you want to pass to the
editor. The list element is associated with the code-block, starting from top to
bottom.

``` js
send.lia( "ups, something went wrong",
  [[{ row : 1,
      column : 1,
      text : "insert your error info here",
      type : "error"
    },
    {
      row : 2,
      column : 1,
      text : "some general warnings about this line",
      type : "warning"
    }
  ]],
  false); // use true if the output should appear in "info" mode

"LIA: stop";
```
<script>@input</script>


If this seems to complicated, you can also throw and error by using `LiaError`.
The second parameter is used to define the number of code-blocks you use and
then the only thing you require, is to add as much detailed information, which
is similar to the previous example.


``` js
// create a new error with an error message that is
// connected to only one code-block, if you have more,
// increase the number ...
var error = new LiaError("ups something went wrong", 1);

error.add_detail(0, // <- associated code-block
  "insert your error info here",
  "error", 1, 1);

error.add_detail(0, // <- associated code-block
  "some general warnings about this line",
  "warning", 2, 1);


throw(error);
```
<script>@input</script>

#### Examples

##### JavaScript Chartist

A drawing example, for demonstrating that any javascript library can be used,
also for drawing.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/chartist.js/latest/chartist.min.css">

``` javascript
// Initialize a Line chart in the container with the ID chart1
new Chartist.Line('#chart1', {
  labels: [1, 2, 3, 4],
  series: [[100, 120, 180, 200]]
});

// Initialize a Line chart in the container with the ID chart2
new Chartist.Bar('#chart2', {
  labels: [1, 2, 3, 4],
  series: [[5, 2, 8, 3]]
});
```
<script>@input</script>

<div class="ct-chart ct-golden-section" id="chart1"></div>
<div class="ct-chart ct-golden-section" id="chart2"></div>

```
<script> Algebrite.run(`@input`) </script>



```javascript

f=circexp(f)

defint(f,t,0,2*pi)
```
<script> Algebrite.run(`@input`) </script>



##### Elm

```elm
-- Read more about this program in the official Elm guide:
-- https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/buttons.html

import Html exposing (beginnerProgram, div, button, text)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)


main =
  beginnerProgram { model = 0, view = view, update = update }


view model =
  div []
    [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text "-" ]
    , div [] [ text (toString model) ]
    , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
    ]


type Msg = Increment | Decrement


update msg model =
  case msg of
    Increment ->
      model + 1

    Decrement ->
      model - 1
```


##### C++

Teaching other language-basics is also possible, for this example we applied [JSCPP](https://github.com/felixhao28/JSCPP)
to run simple C++ programs:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 120;
    int rslt = 0;
    for(int i=1; i<a; ++i) {
        rslt += i;
        cout << "rslt: " << rslt << endl;
    }
    cout << "final result = " << rslt << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
<script>
  var output = "";
  JSCPP.run(`@input`, "", {stdio: {write: s => { output += s }}});
  output;
</script>

We provide a list of templates with more examples that can be used to start

## Quizzes

Quizzes are an essential element of every online course for students to reflect
and test their knowledge. Lia currently supports three different types of
quizzes which can be tweaked, if required.

### Text Inputs

                                  --{{0}}--
A text input field is defined simply by a newline and two brackets around the
solution word, value or sentence. In the depicted example, the word solution is
the solution. If you enter something else, the check will fail.

Markdown-format: `[[solution]]`

Please enter the word * "solution" * into the text-field!

    [[solution]]

### Single-Choice

                                  --{{0}}--
A single choice quiz can be defined with parenthesis within brackets and an X,
which marks the only correct answer option. The additional text is Lia-Markdown
again.

Markdown-format:

``` markdown
[( )] Wrong
[(X)] This is the **correct** answer
[( )] This is ~~wrong~~ too!
```

Only one element can be selected, but if you want to, you can also have multiple
correct answers!

    [( )] Wrong
    [(X)] This is the **correct** answer
    [( )] This is ~~wrong~~ too!


### Multiple-Choice

                                  --{{0}}--
A multiple choice quiz can be defined with brackets within brackets and an X,
which are used to mark the correct answer option. In contrast to single choice
quizzes, there can be multiple selected choices or no one, which is also allowed.

``` markdown
[[ ]] Do not touch!
[[X]] Select this one ...
[[X]] ... and this one too!
[[ ]] also not correct ...
```

Multiple of them can be selected, or all, or none of them ...

    [[ ]] Do not touch!
    [[X]] Select this one ...
    [[X]] ... and this one too!
    [[ ]] also not correct ...


### Matrix

If you want to, you can combine single-choice and multiple-choice quizzes within
one larger matrix. A header is required and different elements have to be
separated by using parentheses or brackets.

``` markdown
[[:-)] (:-]) [$a^2$]]
[ [X]   [ ]    [X]  ]       a multiple-choice row
[ [ ]   [X]    [ ]  ]       a second one
[ ( )   ( )    (X)  ]       now it is single-choice
[ ( )   (X)    ( )   (X) ]  more or less options are fine too
```

The rest is self-explaining...

    [[:-)] (:-]) [$a^2$]]
    [ [X]   [ ]    [X]  ]       a multiple-choice row
    [ [ ]   [X]    [ ]  ]       a second one
    [ ( )   ( )    (X)  ]       now it is single-choice
    [ ( )   (X)    ( )   (X) ]  more or less options are fine too

### Hints

                                  --{{0}}--
To any type of quiz you can add as many hints as you want, which are revealed in
order by clicking onto the question mark.

Markdown-format:

``` markdown
[[super]]
[[?]] another word for awesome
[[?]] not great or mega
[[?]] hopefully not that bad
[[?]] there are no hints left
```

A text input with additional hints:

    [[super]]
    [[?]] another word for awesome
    [[?]] not great or mega
    [[?]] hopefully not that bad
    [[?]] there are no hints left


### Solution

                                   --{{0}}--
And finally, some quizzes might require some more explanations, if they are
solved or not. That is why, with additional three opening and three closing
brackets you mark the beginning and the end of your solution, which can contain
multiple paragraphs, formulas, program code, videos, etc as well as effects (see
therefor the next section).

Markdown-format:

``` markdown
[[super]]
[[?]] hint 1
[[?]] hint 2
***********************************************************************

                                {{1}}

* {2}{super} as an effect
* $\sum x + 3$

## Effects

There are currently four types of effects, that are supported by liaScript:

1. Inline effects
2. Block effects
3. a narrator
4. and Playback functions

Every effect is defined by two braces around one or two numbers `{{1-2}}`, which
marks the order of their appearance. The second and optional number defines, at
which step the element becomes invisible again.

### Inline Effects

                                   --{{0}}--
Inline effects can be used in nearly all liaScript elements, as already
mentioned, the first number within curly braces defines the number of appearance
while the second part defines those Markdown elements that should be revealed
step wise. If you use 0, then the effect will be revealed immediately.

Use this to highlight important facts and to structure your slides (multiple
effects can be combined, due to the usage of equal numbers):

``` markdown
* no effect here
* but in this line {1}{show *** first ***}
* as well as this one {1-2}{show *** first ***}, which contains two effects
  {2}{![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Creative-Tail-Animal-lion.svg)}
```

* no effect here
* but in this line {1}{show *** first ***}
* as well as this one {1-2}{show *** first ***}, which contains two effects
  {2}{![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Creative-Tail-Animal-lion.svg)}


### Animations

                                   --{{0}}--
To define animations and transitions, you can use the animate.css notation,
simply place an animation definition within the comment tag after the effects,
as it is done within the examples.


See https://daneden.github.io/animate.css for more animation effects.

``` markdown
* {0}{ *bounce* } <!-- class = "animated infinite bounce" style = "animation-delay: 5s;" -->
* {1-2}{zoomIn} <!-- class = "animated zoomIn" -->
* {2-3}{zoomOut} <!-- class = "animated zoomOut" -->
* {3}{![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Creative-Tail-Animal-lion.svg)} <!-- class = "animated rubberBand" -->
```

* {0}{ *bounce* } <!-- class = "animated infinite bounce" style = "animation-delay: 5s;" -->
* {1-2}{zoomIn} <!-- class = "animated zoomIn" -->
* {2-3}{zoomOut} <!-- class = "animated zoomOut" -->
* {3}{![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Creative-Tail-Animal-lion.svg)} <!-- class = "animated rubberBand" -->

### Block Effects

                                   --{{0}}--
Block effects as animations are defined similarly to inline effects, just with
one additional newline after the effect definition. The following Markdown block
is then entirely associated with this effect.

                                   --{{1}}--
You can combine blocks by enclosing them into two lines of equality signs, as
you can see from the examples below, an effect can also contain further effects.


``` markdown
                               {{1-3}}
This is an example for a *single* block effect.

                               {{2-4}}
********************************************************************************

This is an example for a ... wait a second {3 rubberBand}{**multi**} ...
block effect.

* alpha
* beta
* gamma

********************************************************************************
```

                                  {{1-3}}
This is an example for a *single* block effect.

                                  {{2-4}}
********************************************************************************

This is an example for a ... wait a second {3}{**multi**} ...
block effect.

* alpha
* beta
* gamma

********************************************************************************

                                --{{4}}--
You can put spaces before the definition of a block effect, to prevent github
and others from adding the definition to a Markdown paragraph, and thus, to
render the script properly.

### Narrator
<!--
language: en_UK

narrator: UK English Male

@Tom
UK English Male
@end

@Tanja
Russian Female
@end
-->


1. we are using the text-to-speech engine of https://responsivevoice.org
2. the narrator voice must be defined within the initial comment of a script
3. use `--{{number}}--` to indicate what is spoken and when
4. use `--{{number voice}}--` to change the voice for this particular comment
5. you can have multiple comments with the same number, those will be combined,
   but only the voice of the first one is used

``` markdown
                                --{{1}}--
The entire ***Markdown*** paragraph right below the effect definition in double
minus notation is sent to responsivevoice to speak the text out loud. If you
click on the ear button at the navigation panel, then this paragraph gets
rendered at the place where it is defined.

                                --{{2}}--
The narrator voice is defined within the initial comment, but you can reset this
for the entire section, by adding such a definition directly after the title
tag, or you can add a voice directly after the comment number to let your script
talk in different languages. Proceed and listen ;-)

                                --{{3 Deutsch Female}}--

Первоначально создан в 2004 году Джоном Грубером (англ. John Gruber) и Аароном
Шварцем. Многие идеи языка были позаимствованы из существующих соглашений по
разметке текста в электронных письмах. Реализации языка Markdown преобразуют
текст в формате Markdown в валидный, правильно построенный XHTML и заменяют
левые угловые скобки («<») и амперсанды («&») на соответствующие коды сущностей.

#### Hidden TTS

Sometimes it might be necessary to add a comment or to read a part aloud to
underline a certain point, which might be necessary in the narrated mode, but
not in the Textbook. Therefor it is possible to put your TTS output into simple
HTML comments. This wont be shown to anyone and also not visible on most other
Markdown parsers and renderer.

```html
<!-- --{{1}}--
Speak this out, but do not show it to anyone.
-->
```

<!-- --{{1}}--
Speak this out, but do not show it to anyone.
-->

### Playback

Since Text2Speech output is baked into the LiaScript notation, why not using it
on purpose for language learners. Thus, you can use `{{|>}}` or `{{!>}}` to
indicate, what should be spoken out loud. You can of course also use different
voices.

```Markdown
    {{|>}}
This entire paragraph will be spoken out __LOUD__.

    {{!> Australian Female}}
* But in this case, this can also be combined
* with a couple of
* - different
  - Markdown elements
  - whether it makes sense or not.
```

    {{|>}}
This entire paragraph will be spoken out __LOUD__.

    {{!> Australian Female}}
* But in this case, this can also be combined
* with a couple of
* - different
  - Markdown elements
  - whether it makes sense or not.

#### Playback-Blocks


And of course, it is also possible to combine various elements by using the
LiaScript block notation. Simply add as many Markdown-blocks between two lines
of stars and they will be interpreted as one larger block.


```Markdown
                  {{|>}}
**************************************************
This entire paragraph will be spoken out __LOUD__.

* But in this case, this can also be combined
* with a couple of
* - different
  - Markdown elements
  - whether it makes sense or not.

**************************************************
```

                  {{|>}}
**************************************************
This entire paragraph will be spoken out __LOUD__.

* But in this case, this can also be combined
* with a couple of
* - different
  - Markdown elements
  - whether it makes sense or not.
**************************************************


#### Animations to Playback

Since we are using the double braces notation for playback elements, this can
also be used in combination with animation effects, simply by adding an a
appearance number or  an appearance and dissappearance number. Depending o the
current state of the animation, this will result in different sentences.


```Markdown
    {{1 |>}}
This is an example where {|> 1-2}{I go} _{|> 2}{I am going}_ to work.
```


    {{1 |>}}
This is an example where {|> 1-2}{I go} _{|> 2}{I am going}_ to work.


#### Inlining

And as presented before, you can also use inlining for Playback elements, as it
was used for animations by simply using two pairs of braces
`{|>}{text to speak}` or `{!>}{text to speak}`. While the first looks familiar,
the second type of writing can be used in tables, so it does not interfear with
other Markdown interpreters.

If you only want to show only the play buttons but not the text, it is possible
to use some HTML tricks. The easiest way is to put your text into an HTML
element like `<span style="display: none">Text to read</span>` and make it
invisible by using the attribute `display: none`.

But, since it is possible to define custom [Macros](#macros), you can use also a
more elegant way. Simply add the following comment directly after your Markdown
heading. The `@play` macro has two parameters one for the voice and the other
for the text, the other macros simply define the voice and pass the text as a
second parameter. Within the Arabic macro it is also possible to set the gender
of the narrator.

## Charts

In many cases, a diagram is only used to present some kind of signal paths,
some primitive functions, some clusters or point clouds.

You can still generate images, but why not applying some basic kind of ASCII-art
to solve the most common tasks.

### Multi-Line-Plots

                             --{{0}}--
Next to stars, you can also use any kind of character to define another line,
where the character defines the color. For example an r marks the color red and
a b the color blue.

Markdown-format:

```markdown

|    r                                       (r imaginary course)

### Dot-Plots

                                 --{{0}}--
If the there are more point with the same character for one x-value, then only
dots are plotted. And by using upper and lower case characters you can also
define the size of the dots.

Markdown-format:

```markdown
    10 |        rrrrrrrrrrrr    x
       |    rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
       |  rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  BBBBB
       | rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  BBBBBBBB

### Colors

The color codes are somehow defined by the character itself, see the list.

| char | color        | hex       |
| ---- | ------------ | --------- |
| `a`  | Amber        | `#FFBF00` |
| `b`  | Blue         | `#0000FF` |
| `c`  | Cyan         | `#00FFFF` |

| `v`  |              | `#EE82EE` |
| `w`  |              | `#FFFFFF` |
| `y`  |              | `#FFFF00` |
| `z`  | Zomp         | `#39A78E` |

### Shapes

The shape of the dot is also defined by the character, see the example below.

```text
6 | + * #           A a B b
  | C c D d E e F f G g H h
  | I i J j K k L l M m N n
  | o O P p Q q R r S s T t
  | U u V v W w X x Y y Z z
1 +------------------------
  0                      24
```

    6 | + * #           A a B b
      | C c D d E e F f G g H h
      | I i J j K k L l M m N n
      | o O P p Q q R r S s T t
      | U u V v W w X x Y y Z z
    1 +------------------------
       0                     24


### Line types

As depicted in the line diagrams below, next to different colors, lines and dots
can have different shapes, whether they are dashed, dotted, smoothed or not.

```text
|                 * *    +  +    #  #
|                *   *  +    +  #    #

## Surveys

                             --{{0}}--
A script should not define a one-way road to the student! So surveys are
required.

### Text-Inputs

Similar to text-quizzes, use the following syntax to define a text-survey, where
the number of underlines defines the presented line numbers:

   `[[___ ___ ___ ___]]`

What is your opinion on ... :

    [[____ ____ ____ ____]]

### Single Choice Vector

                              --{{0}}--
And also this kind of survey is similar to a single choice quiz, but in this
case numbers within parenthesis are used to define some kind of variable
identifier. That is why they do not have to be in order.

```markdown
[(1)] option 1
[(2)] option 2
[(3)] option 3
[(0)] option 0
```

You can only select one option:

    [(1)] option 1
    [(2)] option 2
    [(3)] option 3
    [(0)] option 0


### Multi Choice Vector

                               --{{0}}--
Similar to multi-choice quizzes, you can define multi-choice survey vectors with
a number in double square brackets. But, and this is also possible for all other
kinds of surveys you can define some kind of variable name with a starting colon.

```markdown
[[red]]         is it red
[[green]]       green
[[blue]]        or blue
[[dark purple]] no one likes purple ( last chance ;-) )
```

Select some of your favored colors!

    [[red]]         is it red
    [[green]]       green
    [[blue]]        or blue
    [[dark purple]] no one likes purple ( last chance ;-) )

### Single Choice Matrix

                              --{{0}}--
For defining survey blocks you only have to a header row, whose definition is
also used by the trailing rows.

Markdown-format:

```markdown
[(totally)(agree)(unsure)(maybe not)(disagree)]
[                                             ] liaScript is great?
[                                             ] I would use it to make online **courses**?
[                                             ] I would use it for online **surveys**?
```

    [(totally)(agree)(unsure)(maybe not)(disagree)]
    [                                             ] liaScript is great?
    [                                             ] I would use it to make online **courses**?
    [                                             ] I would use it for online **surveys**?

### Multi Choice Matrix

                               --{{0}}--
I guess, multi-choice blocks are self-explanatory...

Markdown-format:

```markdown
[[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]]
[                     ] question 1 ?
[                     ] question 2 ?
[                     ] question 3 ?
```

Result:

    [[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]]
    [                     ] question 1 ?
    [                     ] question 2 ?
    [                     ] question 3 ?



## ASCII-Art #2

Well, thanks to the great project [SvgBob](https://github.com/ivanceras/svgbob)
the newest version of LiaScript also has support for some basic ASCII art
drawings (not everything is supported yet). Simply use 4 or more backtics to
enclose your artwork and draw whatever you want. And as with any other element,
you can add some styling within HTML comments at the head of this element.

The following examples are taken from the examples on the SvgBob project site.


If you want to use a drawing tool for this, visit the online editor at:

`````````

## Macros

Macros are an easy way in LiaScript to hide reoccurring or tedious tasks. In
essence, they define a simple textsubstitution-system that can be parameterized
and also imported from other courses. Actually, everything that starts with an
`@`-symbol can be replaced by something that has been defined in the main-header
or sub-header of your document.

By now, you will have seen or changed macros like `author`, `logo`, or `comment`,
but you can do even more.

``` markdown
<!--
author: someone who wants to create something new

email: your contact-information
-->

# Main Title
```


### Single Line

There are actually two types of macros, single line macros and block macros.
While the first one only returns a single line, the latter one preserves your
custom indentation. This single line macros start with a macro-name, which is
followed by a colon. The name has to start with a word-character. The starting
`@`-symbol is optional, but I would suggest to use it for custom macros and to
increase readability.

``` markdown
<!--
author: someone who wants to create something new

@Single.line: you can add as much content as you
  want to your single-line macro!

  The only thing that is important, is to use
     indentation.

     Not __matter__ how [much](#12) it is.

-->

# Main Title

@Single.line  <-- this will be replaced at compile-time by: v

you can add as much content as you want to your single-line macro! The only thing that is important, is to use indentation. Not __matter__ how [much](#12) it is.

@author <-- by: someone who wants to create something new
```

By the way, macros are case-sensitive, thus there is a difference between
`@author` and `@Author`.

### Blocks

Block-macros are not followed by an colon and are parsed until they reach the
`@end` symbol. Every macro can also be used to define Markdown content, HTML,
CSS, or even JavaScirpt.

``` md
<!--
@smile: ;-)

@block
this type of macro preserves the structure.

<h1>
@smile and you can also use macros, that
define other macros
</h2>

| Header 1   | Header 2   | Header 3   |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| Item 1     | Item 2     | Item 3     |

<script>alert("hello world")</script>
@end
-->

# Main Title

@block
```


### Comments

Commenting macros out or simply adding additional "personal" information to
to a section happens with two additional `@@` for single-line, and three `@@@`s
to comment blocks...

``` md
<!--
@@comment: this is a single line macro
  that has been commented out

@@ if you prefer it, comment blocks can
@@ be defined like this
@@ ...

@@@block-comments

start with three @s and go until the
parser reaches ...

@end
-->
```

### Overwriting Macros

Actually every section can define its own set of macros, that only exist in that
in that single section. Only the initial main-header at the start of a document
defines a set of global macros. This might be useful, if you want to switch the
voice of the narrator, authorship, etc.


``` markdown
<!--
...
narrator: US English Female

-->

# Main Title

....

### Some other section
<!--
author: another author for this section
...
narrator: Australian Male

-->


```

### Passing Parameters

It is also possible to pass parameters to macros, which looks like calling a
function in most common programming languages. Simply call a macro with
parentheses and put into everything, that you want to place within the macro,
where something is placed is simply defined by an `@ + a number`, thus `@0`,
`@1`, .., `@n`. Like most programming languages start counting at `0`, also in
LiaScript `@0` defines the first parameter.

``` markdown
<!--
@highlight: <b style="color: red">@0</b>
-->

@highlight(I want this text to be read and bold)

```


The following example shows, how multiple parameters can be passed to a macro,
they are simply separated by commas. The main problem which appears is that, if
you want to pass a string that contains commas, then this string has to be
placed in backticks. As also depicted, a macro can also call/substitute another
macro, which might be extremely useful if you have defined a very complex macro.
You can define more "simple" macros, that call the "complex" one by setting some
some default values, see therefor section [uid](#uid).

``` markdown
<!--
@highlight: <b style="color: red">@0</b>

@red_and_green:
  @highlight(@0) <i style="color: green">@1</i>
-->

@red_and_green(red,`simply, simply, green`)
```


Last but not least, in order to go on with the basic Markdown syntax, it is also
possible to pass multi-line parameters. How would you do this? Of course simply
by using a common Markdown code-block with three backtics.

````` markdown
@red_and_green(red,```please to not use
this in production...

* it is better to write Markdown
* directly
```)
`````

As mentioned in the code, try to avoid this, since it generates ugly Markdown
code on GitHub or on any other Markdown-interpreter/editor. But you can also use
a code-block, which contains information about syntax highlighting and a macro,
that defines the title. The part within the code-block is then simply passed to
the macro as the last and multi-line parameter.

````` markdown
<!--
link:   https://pannellum.org/css/style.css
        https://cdn.pannellum.org/2.4/pannellum.css

script: https://cdn.pannellum.org/2.4/pannellum.js

@panorama
<div id="panorama_@0" style="width: 100%; height: 400px;"></div>
<script>
  pannellum.viewer('panorama_@0', {
    "type": "equirectangular",
    "panorama": "@1",
    "autoLoad": false,
    "hotSpots": [@2]
});
</script>
@end
-->

```json @panorama("0",https://pannellum.org/images/cerro-toco-0.jpg)
{
  "pitch": 14.1,
  "yaw": 1.5,
  "type": "info",

  "URL": "https://artbma.org/"
},
{
  "pitch": -0.9,
  "yaw": 144.4,
  "type": "info",
  "text": "North Charles Street"
}
```
`````


### Debugging
<!--
@highlight: <b style="color: red">@0</b>

@red_and_green:
  @highlight(@0) <i style="color: green">@1</i>
-->

Creating macros, can be quite difficult, especially if it is about creating and
calling macros nested macros with various parameters. And defining macros in
Atom is somehow similar to navigating in the dark, since it is not possible to
inspect the DOM. But you can escape a macro by and additional `@`, which outputs
a gray and escaped HTML `pre` `code` block.

``` markdown
<!--
@highlight: <b style="color: red">@0</b>

@red_and_green:
  @highlight(@0) <i style="color: green">@1</i>
-->

@@red_and_green(red,`simply, simply, green`)
```


<pre style="background:#CCCCCC"><code>
\<b style="color: red"\>red\</b\> \<i style="color: green"\>simply, simply, green\</i\></code></pre>

### Special Macros

The following macros are special ones that are used by the LiaScript to deal with a couple of convenience functions.

#### `attribute`

Attribution is an important issue.
With the attribute command, you can define the attribution that is showed within the info field within the navigation panel.
These elements get also imported if you import the functionality from another course.

A good attribution might look like the following ones...

```md
<!--
attribute: [AlaSQL](https://alasql.org)
  by [Andrey Gershun](agershun@gmail.com)
  & [Mathias Rangel Wulff](m@rawu.dk)
  is licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

attribute: [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com)
  by [Matthew Holt](https://twitter.com/mholt6)
  is licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
-->
```

#### `author`

The author information is visible within the information panel as well as on the course-card on the home-screen.

```md
<!--
author: Your name
-->
```

#### `comment`

This information is shown at the course-card at the home-screen.
It should contain a short and precise description of your course.
This macro will only show one paragraph, even if you define more content.

```md
<!--
comment: Learn something about ...
  even if you insert multiple paragraphs

  there will only be one paragraph
-->
```


#### `date`

A convenience function that can be used to show the latest update time to the user.
This is also shown at the information panel.

```md
<!--
date: 08/03/2020
-->
```


#### `dark`

You can change the default appearance of your document, either if you prefer dark mode or light mode.
This will not change the user preferences.
The default mode is defined by the user settings.

```md
<!--
dark: true

@@ or ...

dark: false
-->
```


#### `email`

Simply add some contact information that is shown in the information panel.
This can also be overwritten for every section.

```md
<!--
email: contact@web.de
-->
```


#### `import`

You can import the main macros of other courses, simply by using the `import` command, which is followed by the raw URL of the foreign course.
You can also import various different courses, every URL will be loaded before the course is loaded.
Only the definitions in the main header are loaded, this includes, scripts, css, macros, attribution, and onload.
Our basic templates are currently hosted at https://github.com/LiaTemplates .
Every course basically describes its macros and how to apply them.
Only the content of this course is loaded for speed-reasons, it is currently not possible to load a course, that requires macros of another course and so on.

```` md
<!--
import: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaTemplates/rextester_template/master/README.md
    https://other_url

import: this will import a third url
-->

``` python
print("Hello World")
```
@Rextester.eval(@Python)
````


#### `input`

Use this only in conjunction with executable code and projects or with quizzes.
This macro can only be used in a script tag and gets replaced by the current user input.

To refer to the inputs in a project, use the parameterized macro:

``` md
@input(0)   <== equal to @input
@input(1)
```


#### `language`

Set the internationalization of the course.
This will set basic button information
The currently available languages are defined in:

https://github.com/liaScript/lia-localization

``` md

#### `link`

If you need to load additional CSS files, use `link` followed by the URL of your stylesheet.
Similar to `import` or `script`, you can load multiple files.
See https://github.com/liaScript/custom-style for more information on how to define custom styling.

```md
<!--
link: https://some.css
  https://another.css
-->
```


#### `logo`

The logo definition requires a URL of an image, weather absolute or relative.
It is used to define a background image for the course-card at the home-screen.

```md
<!--
logo: ./pics/logo.png
-->
```

#### `mode`

You can change the default style of your document, either if you do not have any effects you can set mode to `Textbook` or start with and interactive `Presentation`.
The three modes a the same as defined within the document at the upper right button. The default mode is defined by the user settings.

```md
<!--
mode: Presentation

mode: Slides

mode: Textbook
-->
```


#### `narrator`

Set the narrator-voice of your course-speaker.
The voice is a service of https://responsivevoice.org that is free for non-commercial educational content.
The list below shows all currently available voices and languages.

#### `onload`

Sometimes it might be necessary to preload some JavaScript code that is gets executed before the course is loaded.
Or you want to define some global functions that can be used afterwards everywhere.
`onload` actually does the same as its HTML counterpart and is used to accomplish this task.

``` md
<!--
@onload
// this macro contains some important functions that are loaded
// only once ...

alert("Hello World")
@end
-->
```

#### `script`

Load all required JavaScript files/libraries with this command.

``` md
<!--
script: https://some.js
  https://another.js
  ...
-->
```

#### `translation`

If you already have some translated versions of your course or know where they can be found, then use this macro.
Simply add the name and the URL.
This links will be also visible within the information panel of your course.

``` md
<!--
translation: Deutsch  translations/German.md
translation: Français translations/French.md
translation: Русский  translations/Russian.md
-->
```

#### `uid`

This macro can only be used within the document, not within the header.
Sometimes it is necessary to define unique identifiers if you want to access some HTML nodes and do not want to name every manually.
In this case it might be useful to define hidden macros, that make use of `@uid` which generates a unique identifier, whenever it is called.
See for example https://github.com/liaTemplates/Rextester to see the application of this pattern for creating macros.


```md
<!--
@eval: @hidden_eval(@uid,@input)

@hidden_eval
<script>
// eval @input
...
// and do somethint with the content of "name_.."
document.getElementByName("name_@0")
</script>


<div id="id_@0"></div>

@end
-->
```


#### `version`

A very important information is the `version`, it follows the major.minor.patch
notion. If you start to develop a course, you can leave this out, and you will
be in some kind of development-version or as long as you are in major-version 0
the course should be parsed, every time it is loaded. This is fine for small
courses and no persistent content. But, if you include executable code or
quizzes, this content is stored persistently at IndexedDB directly within your
browser.

If your course is ready or very large, it might make sense to define a major
version, such as `1.0.12`. The benefit of this is, that every time, the user
loads the course, the app tries to download the raw Markdown file and then it
checks the version information, if the version is the same as the one that is
currently stored within IndexedDB, then it does not require to preprocess the
entire document again, instead it directly loads the preprocessed version
directly. This is especially useful for smart phones.

``` markdown
<!--
version: 0.0.1
...
-->

# Main Title
```


__So how to change the version information?__

If you only fix typos or add or change static content, it is sufficient enough
to increase the patch element and thus for example `1.0.14` to `1.0.15`.

If you add slides to the end of your document, it is okay to increase the minor
version number, eg. going from `1.0.15` to `1.1.0`.

Major versions changes are required, if you change the structure of your
document, especially quizzes and code. As already mentioned these persistent
state information are stored within IndexedDB, but moving code or quizzes from
one slide to another will might destroy previous states. For this purpose major
version changes are required (`1.1.0` -> `2.0.0`), which will result in a new
version also in IndexedDB. The old code/state is still available and can be
restored.


## Future Work

* Better integration with github/gitlab and the versioning of courses
* Automagically analyzed surveys
* Integration of WebGl and a 3D navigation
* Better Inline function-plotter
